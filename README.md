Note: If you enjoy the extension, I would appreciate and be very grateful if you endorse me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxi-ruti-202988227/) ðŸ˜‡, because it would help me tremendously.

Some times the only thing that will help you solve your (coding) problem is to take a break and clear out your mind.

And there is no better way of doing that than looking at something that makes us feel good.

This extension will be always there when you need to have that small break.

The main purpose of this extension is that you laugh.
